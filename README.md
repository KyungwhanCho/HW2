# Q2
# Our group used a mod podge covered dice except the side of 6.
# Before we rolled the dice, we predicted the uneven weight distribution would create noticable unfairness.
# In PP1 we got 6, so we considered unfair.
# In PP2 we got three 6s, so we considered fair.
# In PP3 we got 17 6s, so we considered fair.
# Our prediction was wrong in PP2 and PP3.
# The larger the sample size the more accurate information we got.
# We figured that making an unfair dice was more difficult than we thought.
